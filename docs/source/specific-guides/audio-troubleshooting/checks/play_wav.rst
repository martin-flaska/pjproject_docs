Checking by playing a WAV file
===========================================================

Play WAV file with pjsua
----------------------------------------

An easy way to check if speaker is functioning properly is by using
**pjsua** to play a WAV file to the speaker, with these easy steps:

#. Find any WAV file with the following specification:

   -  any clock rate
   -  **mono** (not stereo)
   -  16bit, PCM sample
#. Run pjsua with the file:

   .. code-block:: shell

       $ ./pjsua --play-file THEFILE.WAV

#. Check that the file is registered to the bridge:

   ::

     >>> cl
     Conference ports:
     Port #00[16KHz/10ms] Primary Sound Capture Driver  transmitting to:
     Port #01[16KHz/10ms]          THEFILE.WAV  transmitting to:

#. Play the file to the speaker:

   ::

     >>> cc 1 0
     Success
     
#. Done. You should hear the file played to the speaker.

If you couldnâ€™t hear the file played properly to the speaker, then
follow the next step.

If first check fails, try playing the WAV file with playfile sample
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If the file is **not** playing properly with pjsua, then try playing the
file with :source:`pjsip-apps/src/samples/playfile.c` sample. The *playfile* sample binary should
be put in ``pjsip-apps/bin/samples`` directory after the samples project
is successfully built.

To play a WAV file with *playfile* sample:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ ./playfile THEFILE.WAV

The difference between pjsua and playfile program is the lack of
conference bridge in playfile.

If no audio is heard with both pjsua and playfile
-----------------------------------------------------

Chances are other apps are unable to play to that sound device either. Please follow
general sound device troubleshooting for your operating system. Some of the
problems may include:

- the speaker is not working properly
- the level is set too low
- the WAV file contains blank recording
